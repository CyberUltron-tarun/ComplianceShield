Tier 1,Organization Risk Governance,"At the organizational level, risk management focuses on strategic governance and enterprise-wide decisions. Senior leadership establishes the overall risk management strategy, defines risk tolerance, and ensures alignment with regulatory, legal, and business requirements. This tier provides the foundation for cascading risk-informed decisions to mission/business processes and system levels.","1. Has the organization established a risk governance framework (roles, responsibilities, committees)?
2. Is there a defined risk tolerance statement approved by senior leadership?
3. Are risk decisions documented and communicated across the enterprise?
4. Are policies updated when new regulations or strategic priorities emerge?","Business Process Maps / Workflow Documentation, Governance Framework / Roles & Responsibilities Charter, Policies / Documented Risk Management Strategy, Regulatory Compliance Register, Risk Decision Records / Approval Minutes, Risk Tolerance / Appetite Statement",
Tier 2,Mission/Business Process Risk Integration,"At the mission/business process level, organizations integrate risk considerations into workflows, priorities, and resource allocation. This involves mapping critical processes to strategic objectives, identifying process owners, and managing dependencies to avoid cascading failures. Risk-aware processes ensure mission resilience and effective delivery of organizational goals.","1. Are mission/business processes mapped to organizational objectives and risk tolerance?
2. Are business process owners accountable for risk decisions?
3. Are interdependencies between processes assessed for cascading risks?
4. Are business processes prioritized for risk mitigation funding and resources?","Business Process Maps / Workflow Documentation, Business Process Owner Assignments, Dependency / Interdependency Analysis Records, Risk Decision Records / Approval Minutes, Risk Mitigation Budget / Resource Allocation Records, Risk Tolerance / Appetite Statement",
Tier 3,System-Level Risk Management,"At the information system level, risk management applies to individual systems throughout their lifecycle. This includes system categorization per FIPS 199, applying appropriate security controls from NIST SP 800-53, and aligning system-level risk decisions with Tier 1 and Tier 2 strategies. Risks from supply chains, vendors, and service providers are also assessed at this tier.","1. Are information systems categorized per FIPS 199 impact levels?
2. Are baseline security controls selected and tailored per SP 800-53?
3. Are risks from external service providers and supply chains considered?
4. Are risk decisions at system level aligned with Tier 1 and Tier 2 strategies?","Risk Decision Records / Approval Minutes, Security Control Selection & Tailoring Records (SP 800-53), System Categorization Records (FIPS 199), Third-Party / Supply Chain Risk Assessments",
Step 1,Risk Framing,"Risk framing establishes the context for all risk-related activities by defining assumptions, constraints, risk tolerances, and trade-offs. This results in a documented risk management strategy that guides risk assessment, response, and monitoring. The risk frame is influenced by governance structures, legal/regulatory environments, and organizational culture, and must adapt to evolving threats and missions.","1. Has the organization documented a formal risk management strategy?
2. Are assumptions and constraints explicitly identified and approved by leadership?
3. Are governance structures clear on authority for making risk decisions?
4. Is the risk management strategy reviewed in response to changing threat, legal, or business environments?","Enterprise-wide Risk Assessment Reports, Governance Authority Documentation, Management Review Minutes for Risk Strategy, Policies / Documented Risk Management Strategy, Regulatory Compliance Register, Risk Assessment Reports & Communication Records, Risk Assumptions & Constraints Register, Risk Decision Records / Approval Minutes, Risk Tolerance / Appetite Statement",
Step 2,Risk Assessment,"Risk assessment identifies threats, vulnerabilities, likelihoods, and impacts to organizational operations, assets, individuals, and other stakeholders. It provides the basis for risk-informed decisions by evaluating potential adverse events and their consequences. Assessments are conducted at all tiers, integrated across processes and systems, and updated regularly or when significant changes occur.","1. Are enterprise-wide risk assessments performed at defined intervals?
2. Are risk assessments integrated across Tier 1, 2, and 3?
3. Do assessments include both cyber and non-cyber threats (natural disasters, supply chain disruptions)?
4. Are risk assessment results documented and disseminated to decision makers?
5. Are assessments updated when significant changes to systems or threat environment occur?","Business Process Maps / Workflow Documentation, Enterprise-wide Risk Assessment Reports, Policies / Documented Risk Management Strategy, Risk Assessment Reports & Communication Records, Risk Decision Records / Approval Minutes, Third-Party / Supply Chain Risk Assessments",
Step 3,Risk Response,"Risk response involves selecting and implementing strategies to address identified risks, such as mitigation, transfer, acceptance, or avoidance. Organizations must document chosen responses, assign accountability, and track progress. Residual risks are reviewed and explicitly accepted by the appropriate authorities, ensuring transparency and accountability.","1. Are risk response options (mitigation, transfer, acceptance, avoidance) evaluated systematically?
2. Are selected risk responses documented in risk treatment or action plans?
3. Is accountability assigned for implementing response actions?
4. Are response actions tested for effectiveness?
5. Are residual risks reviewed and accepted at the appropriate tier?","Governance Authority Documentation, Management Review Minutes for Risk Strategy, Policies / Documented Risk Management Strategy",
Step 4,Risk Monitoring,"Risk monitoring is an ongoing activity that tracks identified risks, evaluates the effectiveness of risk responses, and detects emerging threats. Monitoring provides feedback loops to refine the risk frame, assessments, and responses. This ensures continuous improvement in risk posture, informed decision-making, and resilience in the face of changing environments.","1. Is there an ongoing risk monitoring program integrated with ISCM (SP 800-137)?
2. Are risk indicators and metrics defined for monitoring effectiveness?
3. Are monitoring results reviewed by governance bodies (e.g., risk committees)?
4. Is feedback from monitoring used to update the risk frame, assessment, and response processes?
5. Are legal, regulatory, and threat environment changes tracked and reflected in monitoring?","Business Process Maps / Workflow Documentation, Enterprise-wide Risk Assessment Reports, Governance Framework / Roles & Responsibilities Charter, Management Review Minutes for Risk Strategy, Regulatory Compliance Register, Risk Assessment Reports & Communication Records, Risk Decision Records / Approval Minutes",
