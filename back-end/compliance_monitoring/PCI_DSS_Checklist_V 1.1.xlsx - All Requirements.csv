Visitor Management,74,"Visitor access is authorized, logged, escorted as needed, and logs are retained. This requirement is essential for ensuring PCI DSS v4.0.1 compliance. It reduces the risk of unauthorized access, enforces consistent security practices, and provides assurance that controls are implemented and operating effectively. Auditors will expect documented policies, technical enforcement, monitoring evidence, and validation that the control remains effective over time.","1. Is visitor access controlled and logged?

Wireless Connected to CDE,75,"Wireless segments connected to or impacting the CDE are identified, documented, and protected with strong security controls. This requirement is essential for ensuring PCI DSS v4.0.1 compliance. It reduces the risk of unauthorized access, enforces consistent security practices, and provides assurance that controls are implemented and operating effectively. Auditors will expect documented policies, technical enforcement, monitoring evidence, and validation that the control remains effective over time.","1.

Wireless Encryption,76,"Wireless networks transmitting CHD use strong encryption (WPA2/WPA3) and unique keys; defaults are changed. This requirement is essential for ensuring PCI DSS v4.0.1 compliance. It reduces the risk of unauthorized access, enforces consistent security practices, and provides assurance that controls are implemented and operating effectively. Auditors will expect documented policies, technical enforcement, monitoring evidence, and validation that the control remains effective over time.","1. Is wireless encryption strong and keys non‑default?
